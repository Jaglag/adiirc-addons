Scripts and plugins for AdiIRC

### How to Create your own Plugin

Docs for the API's can be found at http://www.adiirc.com/docs/ .. (click on classes).

You will notice there are no GUI API's yet, i'm open for any API requests for this.

If you want to play with this, but don't know what to do, you can download a sample plugin in Visual Studio C# Express format at http://www.adiirc.com/plugins/MyPlugin.zip

You can download Visual Studio Express at http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/

Any version will do, I just prefer c# :-)

The http://www.adiirc.com/AdiIRCAPI.dll is included in both this zip file and the myplugin project, this is the glue between AdiIRC and the plugin.

Plugins can be installed from the plugins mananger in File -> Plugins. They will be installed to the Plugin/ folder inside the AdiIRC config folder.

Look forward to see some creative plugins, and please ask if you have any problems.
